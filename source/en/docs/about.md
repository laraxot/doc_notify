The laraxot/module_notify is a Laravel module that provides easy-to-use notification services. It allows you to send notifications to various channels, such as email, SMS, Slack, and more.

To use this module in your Laravel project, you first need to install it via composer:

Copy code
composer require laraxot/module_notify
Once installed, you can register the NotifyServiceProvider in your config/app.php file:

Copy code
'providers' => [
    ...
    Laraxot\Module\Notify\NotifyServiceProvider::class,
    ...
]
You can then publish the config file and migration files using the vendor:publish Artisan command:

Copy code
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laraxot\Module\Notify\NotifyServiceProvider"
This will create a config/notify.php file where you can configure the various notification channels and their settings, as well as a database/migrations directory containing the migration files for creating the required database tables.

To create the tables, run the migrate Artisan command:

Copy code
php artisan migrate
Now that the module is installed and configured, you can start sending notifications. To do so, you can use the Notify facade:

Copy code
use Laraxot\Module\Notify\Facades\Notify;

...

// Send a notification to a specific channel
Notify::channel('email')->send('Hello world!');

// Send a notification to multiple channels
Notify::send('Hello world!', ['email', 'sms']);
You can also use the notify() helper function:

Copy code
notify('Hello world!', ['email', 'sms']);
